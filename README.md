# Chatter
This is a web application created using React JS to help people connect and let their voices be heard... literally! 
The goal of the app is to act as a social media platform where people can voice their opinions, tell a funny story, or maybe even something educational.
You can kind of think of this app like twitter, but with audio. This allows the posts to be more personal and easier to consume as you could potentially use 
and listen to the app while cooking, driving, or just doing homework.

To view the app currently:
git clone https://github.com/alexperez33/chatter.git
cd chatter
npm install
npm start

Enjoy!
